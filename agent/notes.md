## Phase 0 Notes
- [x] Prisma7 should be used along with the prisma-client for better performance. 
- [x] scheme.prisma contains invalid config - should be resolved with correct prisma7 configuration.
- [x] seed.mjs can be removed.  use the updated process for seed data by specifying the seed option in prisma.config.ts
- [x] vitest.config.ts can use projects rather than seperate config file.
- [x] why do we have ensure-test-db-url.mjs and reset-test-db.ts as well as ts file equivalent? do we need? 
- [x] listing-repository. can we refactor nextjs server actions for data fetching queries into lib/queries/<feature-name> and for mutating actions lib/actions/<feature-name>
- [x] folder structure: auth/db and any other config should live in the lib folder. remove server folder.  remove repositories folder.  
- [x] check the repo for any files/folders that are not in use and can be removed.
